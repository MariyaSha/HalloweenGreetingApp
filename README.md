<br>
<br>
This is the Halloween Edition of my Flask Greeting App!
<br>

Please note, this application is mean to be deployed with Wayscript X!
<br>
therefore the requirements.txt file only contains a single library.
<br>
If you'd like to deploy it with a service like Heroku, you'll need to
<br>
generate a Procfile and a new requirements.txt file (please see
<br>
the link to a tutorial I've made about it at the very bottom)
<br>
If you want to deploy it <b>directly from your IDE</b> please read more about Wayscript X:
<br>
https://wsxdocs.wayscript.com/
<br>
<br>
<b>What's New?</b>
<br>
Besides the apparent dstyling changes, I've added a list of my favourite Halloween monsters
<br>
and got them to do the greeting ;)
